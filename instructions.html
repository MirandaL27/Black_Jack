                <li>
                    <p>Number cards: value is the same as their number (e.g. two of spades = 2)</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Face cards: 10</p>

                <li>
                    <p> If the dealer has an ace and counting that ace as 11 would put their point total at 17 or over: They must stand.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>Whoever has a point total that is closest to 21 without going over is the winner.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>If the player's total is over 21: The player loses, even if the dealer's total is also over 21.</p>
